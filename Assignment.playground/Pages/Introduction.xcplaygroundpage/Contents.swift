 # Sequence and Structure Assignment
 
 ## Goal
 
 To create an aesthetically pleasing design using repeated visual elements overlaid on a grid.
 
 Designs produced should look good on a laptop skin or t-shirt – this means avoiding very fine detail.
 
 ## Purpose
 
 The purpose of this assessment is to develop a beginning understanding of how to:
 
 * make a plan for specific visual output
 * use programming structures to create the desired output
 * use appropriate terminology to describe code, and write readable code
 
 ## Deliverables
 
 There are three deliverables for this assignment:
 
 1. A plan (access [template here](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/2016-17/ics2o/Making-a-Plan.pdf), and [exemplar here](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/2016-17/ics2o/Part-1-Making-a-Plan-Exemplar.pdf) )
 2. The product (you will use this playground to create products)
 3. An explanation of your code (will be created after March Break)
 
 ## Reminder
 
 Complete at least one plan, photograph it, and post it to Sesame.
 
 Here is an [exemplar for a good plan](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/2016-17/ics2o/Part-1-Making-a-Plan-Exemplar.pdf). Be sure to review this before making your own plan.
 
 *Your plan needs to be approved by me, Mr. Gordon, before you can begin implementing the product.*
 
 The approval is solely so that I can provide you with verbal feedback to help you improve your plan before you begin implementing your ideas in code.
 
 ## Evaluation
 
 Here is the [rubric being used to evaluate your work](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/2016-17/ics2o/Sequence-and-Structure-Product-Rubric.pdf) on this assignment.
